Generage sophisticated query in simple way.


## What's this?
This library is focused to generate (literally) big query for Google BigQuery.
It's similar to SQLAlchemy but simpler and easy to learn.

Features on which I focused are:

 - UPPERCASE syntax that is similar to SQL (and dialects.)
 - Easy to use for non-programmers like data analysts.


## Why some functions are UPPERCASE?
Yes, I know, UPPERCASE functions are not cool and discouraged to use.
